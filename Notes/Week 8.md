### Monday - Wednesday
- Fixing and Cleaning the code
- Tried implementing qreader library to check scannability but it was downloading weights whose download location was not editable, hence had some issue to download on lambda (read-only system except /tmp).
### Thursday
- Implemented try and catch to whole code so that lambda doesn't run again. As if it fails on uncaught error lambda tries again.
### Friday
- Was assigned [[Invite email qrc]].
