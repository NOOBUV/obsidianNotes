In the context of database migrations in frameworks like Django, the `--fake` option is used to mark migrations as applied without actually executing the database schema changes associated with those migrations. This can be contrasted with normal migration application, which involves applying the changes to the database.

Let's explore the differences between applying migrations normally and using the `--fake` option:

1. **Normal Migration Application:**
   - When you run migrations without the `--fake` option, the actual database schema changes specified in the migration files are applied to the database.
   - This involves executing the SQL statements generated by the migration files to create or alter tables, fields, indexes, etc.
   - Data migrations, if included in the migration files, will also be executed, allowing you to transform or migrate existing data.

   Example command:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

2. **Fake Migration Application (`--fake`):**
   - When you use the `--fake` option, it marks migrations as applied in the database schema history without actually performing the associated schema changes.
   - This is useful when you want to update the migration history without applying the changes, often for scenarios like syncing the migration history between different environments without affecting the database.
   - Data migrations are not executed when using `--fake`, so it's only useful for marking schema-related migrations as applied.

   Example command:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate --fake
   ```

In summary, the key difference lies in whether the actual database schema changes are applied or not. Using `--fake` is a way to update the migration history without making the corresponding changes to the database schema. It's important to use `--fake` cautiously, and it's typically more applicable in specific scenarios such as database synchronisation between environments.

Faking helped me in scenario where an error was thrown that a particular column already existed hence the migration was applied but wasn't recorded so faking the migration helped clearing that error out.
