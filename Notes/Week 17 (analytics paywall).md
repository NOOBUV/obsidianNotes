### Monday
- Was trying to implement the logic of the banner but got stuck as i wanted to wait for the functions api's to resolve than run the logic.
- So shreedhar suggested to use Promise.all() and instead of making every api observable object convert it into promise and push into the array and use the Promise.all() and code the part inside it which you want to run.
### Tuesday
- Completed with the logic of banner.
- Completed with the implementation of date premium modal and redirecting to pricing page.
